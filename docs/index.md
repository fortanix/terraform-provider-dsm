# Introduction

The DSM Terraform Provider transforms the Fortanix Data Security Manager RESTful API functionality into easy to consume Terraform configurations. The usage of DSM Terraform Provider eliminates the need to understand how to consume raw Fortanix Data Security Manager APIs.

## Prerequisites

### Fortanix DSM Setup

The usage of DSM Terraform Provider assumes the following is pre-configured in one's environment:

* Up-to-date DSM deployment:
  * Trial / Test environment maybe provisioned via [amer.smartkey.io](https://amer.smartkey.io)
* Production / Test account or tenant has already been provisioned within Fortanix DSM.

### Authentication and Configuration

* **Note**: One of the following Authentication methods needs to be available during the DSM Terraform Provider initial setup.

| Authentication methods | Required Attributes                                               | Description |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `Username & Password`  | 1. username <br> 2. password <br> 3. account id                   | Username, Password and an Account ID should be configured. Account ID can be found in DSM UI by going to settings. |
| `Admin API key`        | API key                                                           | An Admin API key can be configured in DSM UI by going to settings(Administrative Apps).           |
| `LDAP Authentication`  | 1. username <br> 2. password <br> 3. account id <br> 4. LDAP name | An LDAP integration can be done in DSM UI by going to settings(Authentication, SINGLE SIGN-ON and ADD LDAP INTEGRATION). |


## DSM

Initial setup of the Fortanix DSM Provider to interact using Terraform.

## Example Reference

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    dsm = {
      version = "0.5.32"
      source = "fortanix/dsm"
    }
  }
}

// Configure with username and password
provider "dsm" {
    endpoint = "https://amer.smartkey.io"
    username = "test@user.com"
    password = "12345678"
    acct_id  = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```

```terraform
// Configure with API key
provider "dsm" {
    endpoint = "https://amer.smartkey.io"
    api_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```

```terraform
// Configure with LDAP configuration
provider "dsm" {
    endpoint = "https://amer.smartkey.io"
    username = "test@user.com"
    password = "12345678"
    acct_id  = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    ldap_name = "TEST_LDAP"
}
```

* **Note**: All the below examples are configured by username and password, these examples can also be configured with api_key or ldap_name

```terraform
// Disable the SSL
provider "dsm" {
    endpoint = "https://amer.smartkey.io"
    username = "test@user.com"
    password = "12345678"
    acct_id  = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    insecure = false
}
```

```terraform
// Configure aws profile
provider "dsm" {
    endpoint = "https://amer.smartkey.io"
    username = "test@user.com"
    password = "12345678"
    acct_id  = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    /* default: $HOME/.aws/
    Or a file should be specified that contains aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key, aws_session_token(Optional) and region
    */
    aws_profile = "default"
    aws_region = "us-east-2"
}
```
```terraform
// Configure azure_ region
provider "dsm" {
    endpoint = "https://amer.smartkey.io"
    username = "test@user.com"
    password = "12345678"
    acct_id  = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    azure_region = "us-east"
}
```

### Attributes usage definitions

- **Required**: This attribute must be provided by the user in the Terraform configuration. If it is not specified, Terraform will return an error during the plan or apply phases.
- **Optional**: This attribute is not mandatory. If it is not provided by the user, Terraform will use a default value (if any). Users can specify it to override the default behavior.
- **Read-Only**: This attribute is output-only and cannot be set by the user. It provides information that is determined by the provider or the state of the resource after it has been created or updated. Also known as a "computed" attribute.
