```terraform

  default = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
// Add quorum policy to a Fortanix DSM account
// Example - 1
/*
When any one of the members approval is required.
In the example, members are users that are configured in the Fortanix DSM account.
Apps can also be the members. e.g. { "app": "<app_uuid>" }
