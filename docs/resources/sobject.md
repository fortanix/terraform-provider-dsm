# dsm_sobject (Resource)

Creates a new security object. The returned resource object contains the UUID of the security object for further references.
A key value can be imported as a security object. This resource also can rotate or copy a security object.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Create a group
resource "dsm_group" "group" {
  name = "group"
  description = "group description"
}
// Create a security object in the above group
resource "dsm_sobject" "sobject" {
  name            = "sobject"
  obj_type        = "AES"
  group_id        = dsm_group.group.id
  key_size        = 256
  key_ops         = [
    "ENCRYPT",
    "DECRYPT",
    "WRAPKEY",
    "UNWRAPKEY",
    "DERIVEKEY",
    "MACGENERATE",
    "MACVERIFY",
    "APPMANAGEABLE",
    "EXPORT"
  ]
  enabled         = true
  expiry_date     = "2025-02-02T17:04:05Z"
  description     = "sobject description"
  custom_metadata = {
    key1 = "value1"
  }
  allowed_key_justifications_policy = [
    "CUSTOMER_INITIATED_SUPPORT",
    "CUSTOMER_INITIATED_ACCESS"
  ]
  allowed_missing_justifications = true
  rotation_policy = {
    interval_days = 20
    effective_at = "20231130T183000Z"
    deactivate_rotated_key = true
    rotate_copied_keys = "all_external"

```This is a sample variable that specifies fpeOptions to create a Tokenization object that can tokenize credit card format data:
    variable "fpeOptionsExample" {

      description = "The policy document. This is a JSON formatted string."
      default = <<-EOF 
              {
               "description":"Credit card"
               "format": {
               "char_set": [

                     "0",
                     "9"

This is how we can reference this fpeOptions:
      fpe = var.fpeOptionsExample

Refer to the fpeOptions schema in https://www.fortanix.com/fortanix-restful-api-references/dsm for a better understanding of the fpe body.
