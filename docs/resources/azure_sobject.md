# dsm_azure_sobject (Resource)

Creates a new security object in Azure key vault. This is a Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK) method and copies an existing DSM local security object to Azure KV as a Customer Managed Key (CMK).

Azure sobject can also rotate, enable soft deletion and purge the key. For examples of rotate and soft deletion, refer Guides/dsm_azure_sobject.

**Note**: Once soft deletion is enabled, Azure sobject can't be modified.

**Deletion of a dsm_azure_sobject:** Unlike dsm_sobject, deletion of a dsm_azure_sobject is not normal.

**Steps to delete a dsm_azure_sobject**:

   * Enable soft_deletion as shown in the examples of `Guides/dsm_azure_sobject`.
   * Enable purge_deleted_key after soft_deletion as shown in the examples of `Guides/dsm_azure_sobject`.
   * A dsm_azure_sobject can be deleted completely only when its state is `destroyed`.
   * A dsm_azure_sobject comes to destroyed state when the key is deleted from Azure key vault.
   * To know whether it is in a destroyed state or not, sync keys operation should be performed.
   * Use `dsm_azure_group` data_source to sync the keys. Please refer Data `Sources/dsm_azure_group`.

## Schema

### Required

- `custom_metadata` (Map of String) Azure CMK level metadata information.
   * `azure-key-name`: Key name within Azure KV.
   * **Note:** By default dsm_azure_sobject creates the key as a software protected key. For a hardware protected key use the below parameter.
   * `azure-key-type`: Type of a key. It can be used in `PREMIUM` key vault. Value is hardware.
- `group_id` (String) The Azure group ID in Fortanix DSM into which the key will be generated.
- `key` (Map of String) A local security object imported to Fortanix DSM(BYOK) and copied to Azure KV.
- `name` (String) The security object name.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The security object description.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the security object will be Enabled or Disabled. The values are true/false.

Purging the key makes all data encrypted with it unrecoverable unless you later import the same key material from Fortanix DSM into the Azure key vault.The DSM source key is not affected by this operation. The supported values are true/false.
 **Note:**  This should be enabled only after the creation.
- `rotate` (String) The security object rotation. Specify the method to use for key rotation:

   * `effective_at`: Start of the rotation policy time.
   * `deactivate_rotated_key`: Deactivate original key after rotation true/false.
   * **Note:** Either interval_days or interval_months should be given, but not both.
- `soft_deletion` (Boolean) Enable soft key deletion in Azure key vault. Key is not usable for Sign/Verify, Wrap/Unwrap or Encrypt/Decrypt operations once it is deleted. The supported values are true/false.
 **Note:**  This should be enabled only after the creation.
- `state` (String) The key states of the Azure KV key. The values are Created, Deleted, Purged.

### Read-Only

- `acct_id` (String) The account ID from Fortanix DSM.
- `creator` (Map of String) The creator of the security object from Fortanix DSM.
   * `user`: If the security object was created by a user, the computed value will be the matching user id.
   * `app`: If the security object was created by a app, the computed value will be the matching app id.
- `dsm_name` (String) The security object name from Fortanix DSM (matches the name provided during creation).
- `external` (Map of String) AWS CMK level metadata:
   * `Version`
   * `Azure_key_name`
   * `Azure_key_state`
   * `Azure_backup`
