# dsm_gcp_sobject (Resource)

Creates a new security object in GCP CDC Group. This is a Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK) method and copies an existing DSM local security object to GCP KMS as a Customer Managed Key (CMK).

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "hmg" {
  default = <<EOF
  {
    "kind": "GcpKeyRing",
    "service_account_email": "test@test.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "project_id": "fortanix",
    "location": "us-east1",
    "key_ring": "key_ring_name",
    "private_key": "<Private component of the service account key pair that can be obtained from the GCP cloud console. It is used to authenticate the requests made by DSM to the GCP cloud>"
  }
  EOF
}

resource "dsm_group" "gcp_cdc" {
  name = "group_gcp"
  hmg = var.hmg
}

resource "dsm_group" "group" {
  name = "group_test"
}

resource "dsm_sobject" "sobject" {
